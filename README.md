# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection-Project

### Problem Statement: Finex is a leading financial service provider which offers a wide range of products and business services based out of Florida, US. Over the last few years, Finex observed a large number of unauthorized transactions are being made and due to which the bank has been facing a huge revenue and profitability crisis. And this is happening because fraudsters use stolen or lost cards and hack the private system to access the personal and sensitive data of many cardholders. They also indulge in ATM skimming at various POS terminals that do not send alerts or do not have an OTP system through the banks.

### Requirement: The branch manager wants to find the root cause of the problem and action areas to come up with a long-term solution that would help the bank generate high revenue with minimum loss

### Solution: With 86% of the recall value, build the machine learning models which helps to find the important features that are the indicator of fraudulent transactions and find the root cause of the problem with the help of Issue Tree Framework and also provide some recommendation based on the analysis
