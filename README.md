# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection-Project

### Problem Statement: Finex is a leading financial service provider which offer a wide range of products and business services based out of Florida, US. Over the last few years, Finex observed a large number of unauthorised transactions are being made and due to which the bank has been facing a huge revenue and profitability crisis. And this is happen because fraudsters use stolen or lost cards and hack the private systems to access the personal and sensitive data of many cardholders. They also indulge in ATM skimming at various POS terminals that do not send alerts or do not have OTP system through banks.

### Requirement: Branch Manager wants to find the root cause of the problem and action areas to come up with a long-term solution that would help the bank generate high revenue with minimum loss.

### Solution: Find the root cause of the problem with the help of Issue Tree Framework and build the machine learning models with the recall value 86% which helps us to find the important features that are the indicator of fraudulent transactions and also provide some recommendation based on that.
